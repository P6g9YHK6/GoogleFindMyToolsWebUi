"""Regression test for a real production incident: FcmReceiver.
register_for_location_updates()/get_fcm_token()/get_android_id() used to
check `self._listening` and call _start_listener_in_background() with no
lock guarding the two steps - a classic check-then-act race. Two devices'
polls landing close together (the common case right after a restart, when
every device's schedule is freshly evaluated at once) could both see
`_listening == False` and both start a listener concurrently against the
same shared FcmPushClient, corrupting its connection state. Observed in
production as "readexactly() called while another coroutine is already
waiting for incoming data", crashing the listener and timing out every
locate that was waiting on it.

Uses real threads and a real (short) delay inside the guarded section,
same approach as tests/test_query_throttle.py's concurrency test - a
single-threaded test can't tell "two callers both started the listener"
apart from "only one did", since nothing else is running concurrently to
race with it.
