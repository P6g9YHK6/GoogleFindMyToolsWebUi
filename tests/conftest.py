"""Shared test fixtures.

Every webui/routers/* module does non-lazy, top-level `from X import Y`
imports, and webui/main.py imports every router unconditionally - so merely
importing webui.main drags in the entire heavy dependency chain (selenium,
undetected-chromedriver, gpsoauth, aiohttp, ...). CI installs all of
requirements.txt + requirements-web.txt for real (proven safe: the project's
own Dockerfile already does exactly that, with no browser/Xvfb present, since
those are only installed at runtime on first login - see
webui/browser_provisioning.py) rather than hand-stubbing those packages.

Real Google/network calls are avoided instead at the function boundary, via
monkeypatch - and because each router does `from webui.deps import X` rather
than `from webui import deps`, patches must target each router MODULE's own
bound name ("patch where it's looked up"), not webui.deps/webui.auth_state
directly.
