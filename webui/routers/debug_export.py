""""Export debug info" button on the Config page (see GitHub issue #23) - a
downloadable snapshot of a fresh device-list query plus a locate attempt for
every device, for attaching to a bug report instead of asking someone to
copy-paste logs by hand.

Bundled as a 7z archive (not zip - the stdlib's zipfile can't write encrypted
archives at all, and 7z's AES-256 is meaningfully stronger than zip's legacy
ZipCrypto anyway) via py7zr, built entirely in memory. A password is
optional: leave it blank for a plain local download, or set one so the
archive is safe to attach to a public issue or hand to someone else without
exposing device locations/emails in the clear.

Three independent toggles shape what actually goes in:
- include_live_query: run a fresh device-list + locate-all query. Off lets
  someone grab just the recent logs without touching Google's API at all
  (and without needing to be signed in for it).
- include_logs: fold in the last _LOG_LINES_LIMIT lines of both the system
  and forwarding logs - the Logs page already shows these, so this defaults
  off; a report that's just the API payload is sometimes all that's wanted.
- anonymize_locations: replaces each decrypted location's real coordinates/
  accuracy/altitude with random numbers and any semantic place name with
  random characters (regenerating map_links to match), so the *shape* of the
  decoded location data is still visible for debugging parsing/forwarding
  logic without exposing where the device actually was. Since that scrubbing
  only touches the decoded JSON, each device's locate/*/raw_hex.txt and
  protobuf_text.txt (the still-encrypted E2EE wire format underneath) are
  left out of the archive entirely rather than included un-scrubbed - see
  _ANONYMIZATION_NOTICE, which is also dropped into the archive itself as
  ANONYMIZATION_NOTICE.txt so this isn't a silent omission.
At least one of include_live_query/include_logs must be set - an archive
with neither would just be an empty manifest.

This route must never surface an actual account credential - it only goes
through request_device_list()/get_location_data_for_device(), which pull
tokens internally (via nova_request()) but never return them to the caller.
Never import Auth.token_cache/Auth.aas_token_retrieval/Auth.adm_token_retrieval
here.
