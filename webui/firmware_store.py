"""Advertisement keys (EIDs) produced by /register, kept around so the
Firmware page (webui/routers/firmware.py) can offer a previously-registered
tracker again instead of requiring the user to copy-paste the one-time value
shown right after registering. Same small-persisted-YAML shape as
webui/device_location_store.py/webui/settings_store.py.

Also remembers the Advanced-section build values (device name, advertising
interval, TX power, unwanted-tracking-protection flag - see
webui/firmware_build.py) last used for each EID, so picking a known EID again
on the Firmware page pre-fills the same settings instead of resetting to
defaults.

And remembers the last identity (display name/device type/manufacturer/
model/image URL, plus the experimental_official_app_compat checkbox - see
SpotApi/CreateBleDevice/create_ble_device.py's register_esp32()) submitted
on the Register form itself - see webui/identity_validation.py. Unlike the
build settings above, this isn't per-EID (it's chosen before a new EID
exists), so it's a single top-level record rather than part of the entries
list.

Each entry also carries its own copy of that same identity (unlike the
single top-level "last used" record above, this one is per-EID and frozen
at registration time) plus a keep_track flag - the Register form's "Keep
track" checkbox. keep_track entries are what the Firmware page's Tracked
Registrations panel shows: see webui/tracked_registrations.py, which
matches them against a live Google device list to report whether each
registration is still there.

Only the public EID and these settings are stored - never the private eik
(see SpotApi/CreateBleDevice/create_ble_device.py, which never returns eik
to the webui at all), so this is no more sensitive than the values the
firmware itself broadcasts openly over BLE.
