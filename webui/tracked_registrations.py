"""Correlates locally-tracked registrations (webui/firmware_store.py's
keep_track entries, from the Register form's "Keep track" checkbox) against
a live Google device list, for the Firmware page's Tracked Registrations
panel (see webui/routers/firmware.py).

Google's ListDevices response has no field carrying back the EID itself, or
a per-device registration timestamp, for Spot/BLE devices (see
ProtoDecoders/decoder.py's get_device_details - registered_at is only ever
populated in the is_phone branch). So there's no exact key to join on -
matching instead compares the identity actually submitted at registration
time (display name/manufacturer/model, plus device type when it's usable)
against what Google echoes back per device. This is reliable whenever each
registration used a distinct identity, the common case, especially with the
identity presets (see webui/registration_presets.py) - but two registrations
left at identical defaults are genuinely indistinguishable from Google's
response alone, see resolve_tracked_status's "ambiguous" status below.
