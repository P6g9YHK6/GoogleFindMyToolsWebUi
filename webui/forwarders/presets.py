"""Canned starting points for the generic query-builder endpoint config.

Picking one of these in the settings UI just pre-fills method/url/headers/
body with a sensible default for that destination - nothing about actually
sending an endpoint (see webui/forwarders/custom.py) branches on which
preset, if any, it came from, and nothing about which preset was used is
ever saved (see webui/routers/settings.py's update_device_settings, which
always writes "type": "custom") - a preset is a one-time template for
starting a *new* endpoint, not an ongoing property of one. Query params
aren't a separate concept either: they're baked directly into each preset's
"url" as a literal querystring, same as a user would type one by hand.
Adding a new destination here needs no new Python function, just a new
entry below.
