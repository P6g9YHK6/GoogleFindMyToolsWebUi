    device_name is this tracker's real name straight from the Google
    account; device_alias is the (optional) local nickname set on the
    Settings page, falling back to device_name when no caller passes one
    explicitly - callers that only ever had one name to give (older code,

    device_alias existed as its own concept. Neither is overridable per
    endpoint - see webui/scheduler.py for where the two are actually told
    apart (device_cfg's "google_name" vs "display_name").

    tracker_id is this app's own internal id for the tracker (its
    canonic_id) - see BUILTIN_VARIABLES_FROM_APP in presets.py, which has
    offered it as a chip since that variable existed but, until now, this
