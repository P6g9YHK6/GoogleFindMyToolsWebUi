# executor. Every blocking call this app makes (device list, locate, sound,
# register - one poll tick per device too, see webui/scheduler.py) goes
# through here, and each one can now legitimately sit waiting on
# query_throttle for a few seconds if several devices' polls land close
# together (the common case: anything on the default schedule shares the
# same */5 * * * * tick) - a small shared pool meant a handful of those
# waits alone could exhaust every worker, leaving unrelated requests (a
# page load, a manual click) with no thread to run on at all. A dedicated,
# generously-sized pool here means a throttle wait only ever costs its own
