"""Optional Apprise-backed failure notifications.

Entirely opt-in: with APPRISE_URLS unset, configure_apprise_logging() is a
no-op and nothing is ever sent. Set it (see https://github.com/caronc/apprise
for the URL format - Discord, Telegram, email, ntfy, dozens more) and every
logger anywhere in the process - webui.*, Auth.*, NovaApi.*, third-party
libraries, all of it - gets forwarded automatically, since this attaches to
the root logger (see _TARGET_LOGGER below) that everything propagates up to
by default. (This used to attach to "webui" only, which missed real failures
logged from outside that tree - e.g. Auth.fcm_receiver's push-client crashes
- until a locate had been silently failing for hours with nothing to show
for it.) Nothing here needs updating as new failure points get added
elsewhere, in any module.
